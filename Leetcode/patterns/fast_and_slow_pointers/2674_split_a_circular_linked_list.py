# solution 1: Naive Approach: Break the Circular List into a Linear List and Rebuild

def splitCircularLinkedList(head):

    tail = head

        tail = tail.next
    tail.next = None  # break the circle

    # Step 2: Count total length

# solution 2: Two-Pass Approach: Find Midpoint, Split, Then Locate Second Tail

    # Edge case: empty list or single node

ï¼ƒsolution 3: Optimized One-Pass Approach: Use Fast Pointer to Identify Tail Directly

def splitCircularLinkedList(head):
    # Edge case: empty list or single node
    if not head or head.next == head:
        return [head, None]

    # Initialize slow and fast pointers

    # Move slow by one and fast by two steps until fast is about to loop back
    while fast.next != head and fast.next.next != head:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

    # For odd-length lists, fast might stop one node before tail
    # Move it one step forward so it points to the actual last node
    if fast.next != head:
        fast = fast.next

    # Second half head is node after slow
    second = slow.next

    # Close the second half circle
    fast.next = second

    # Close the first half circle
    slow.next = head

    return [head, second]
