# solution 1: brute force
# Try all subarrays starting at start and ending at end.
# Sum them one by one and check if they reach or exceed target.
# Stop expanding when valid to minimize unnecessary work.
# Time Complexity: O(n^2)

    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:

# solution 2: Optimized Sliding Window
# Keep a running total of the current window.
# Expand to the right, and whenever the total â‰¥ target, try to shrink from the left to find the smallest valid window.
# Track and update the min_len.
# Time Complexity: O(n)

            # Shrink from the left while the total is valid
            while total >= target:
                min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1)
                total -= nums[left]
